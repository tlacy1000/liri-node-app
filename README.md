# liri-node-app

LIRI  is SIRI's long lost twin sister. She can perform some similar functions, such as telling the user information about a song they like, when their favorite band will be playing a show next, and where to catch a showing of the latest blockbuster. She's an app that uses node to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  Simply tell LIRI what media you want information on, and let her be your personal assistant!
